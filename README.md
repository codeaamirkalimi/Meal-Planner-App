# Description
Meal Planner lets you to make easy and healthy weekly meal plans. You can choose
predefined meal plans from our available catalogue or create your own custom meal plans
by using our meal planner calendar tool accompanied by our list of available recipes.

Our meal plans have been classified according to the amount of calories to facilitate you to
choose the specific meal plan which best fits you and your diet needs.

All recipes provide a list of ingredients, the nutritional values and recipe steps which helps
you to cook them easily.

The list of ingredients for your weekly meal plan shall be automatically added to the
shopping list reminder tool which reminds you to buy the ingredients some days before the
beginning of the week. You can modify the list of ingredients added in the shopping list
reminder manually, set the reminder time frame and display the shopping list in a screen
widget.
